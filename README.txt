# social-transit-preprocessor

A preprocessing script for use in a research project of mine dealing with a public transit design model with social access objectives. Mostly consists of processing raw data from various City of Chicago and CTA data sets to construct network output files for use in my solution algorithm.

The formats of the input and output files are so specific to my applications that I would not expect this script to be useful for anyone except me, however it is being made available for anyone interested.
